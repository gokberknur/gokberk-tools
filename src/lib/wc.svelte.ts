/**
 * Assign each entry of `props` as a DOM **property** on the host element.
 *
 * Why a property, not an attribute: Svelte (like the DOM) sets *attributes* by
 * default on custom elements, which stringifies the value. Custom elements such
 * as `gok-table` accept rich data (`columns`, `rows`) only as JS properties —
 * objects/arrays can't survive attribute stringification. Assigning the property
 * directly hands the live reference to the element.
 *
 * Because the attachment is created inline in markup, Svelte re-creates (and so
 * re-runs) it whenever the passed `props` change — giving us the reactivity we
 * want without an explicit effect.

 * Why addEventListener over an `on<event>` prop: gök custom elements emit
 * hyphenated composed events (`gok-page-change`, `gok-selection-change`,
 * `gok-sort`, `gok-toggle`) as well as plain `change`/`input`. Hyphenated event
 * names have no DOM `on*` property, so the only robust, framework-agnostic way
 * to subscribe is `addEventListener`. The returned teardown removes the
 * listener when the element leaves the DOM.
